"My empathy is killing me"
(but it is not killing you,)

Participant observations- 
Everything can be picked apart from the outside
I thought of this as provocative 
But that's not true 
I got drunk- I threw a party- couldn't keep my eyes open (couldn't keep you open)
Not setting an alarm for tomorrow when the daylight is good enough / why do you want more than that? 
It's like your hair doesn't want to leave your body- but it does anyway, it has to.

Look at everything you cannot keep- look at it with a pale indifference, I am not just breaking for the hell of it- not these past few weeks. 

All I need is to be broken up into just a body. For you to sleep better at night. 
I could come into the room, doused in silver, dripping in gold and still I would not find your hand to hold- grab out from the crowd- 
lick your fingers, grab off from my mouth- tear at words, run at different worlds...

You say it's all simple- 
I know 
I want to practice what you say, 
I do not understand how you can unpack things as you do- see the ends of strings while they are all rolled up.

There are other sides of you I need to see- so I ask you the fucked up questions before you fall asleep- 
there are other sides of you I need to see- 
so I don't spend the night anymore. 
Why do you stay inside of me? If parts of you are hiding- and your pride, or someone else's memory has you by the tongue, 
why do you have to hold me by the hair in order to forget?

 I didn't want to meet you. Just like you didn't want to meet me- I'm sure. 

I went to go look at Monet and I knew I didn't need you but it wasn't a matter of need, 

so I want and want and want-
 all the while we break- 
 smash against rocks, across the shore- spread out into the sand- and the wind howls around, 
 laughs with us as we tumble- because what else could we do with bloody gums- 
 with mouths that say "I love you" in all the battle, 

our last weapon is laughter.
